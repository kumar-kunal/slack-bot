or recognize them for stellar performance how does regie calculate the personalized email score the regie ai email analyzer automatically assesses all emails that are sent by users of the platform for content uniqueness for an email to count as personalized either the body of the email or the email s opener must be personalized this requires more than 10 of its content to be distinct from all other emails being sent otherwise the email won t count as personalized once analyzed by regie ai where can you locate the personalization scores for your workspace 1 within your regie platform on the left side navigation menu expand the co pilot section and select team dashboard 4 this opens the team dashboard and provides you chrome extension usage and personalization analytics for all users of the workspace within the team dashboard you can monitor the overall percentage of emails analyzed by regie and considered personalized how do we determine the percentage of personalized emails sent out of the total number of emails analyzed regie ai tracks the total number of those that are considered personalized which is reflected as an overall percentage the percent of emails personalized metric provides managers quick insight into the amount of personalization occurring across emails being sent by the team through their sales engagement platform and linkedin sales navigator we recommend striving for a range of 80 100 personalized emails being sent note regie cannot determine the level of personalization applied to emails sent from email clients such as outlook or gmail use the timeframe users or platform filters sales engagement platform or linkedin sales navigator to narrow down the scope of personalization occurring as well these filters are found on the top of your team dashboard as shown below tracking the amount of personalization being applied by specific users on the team dashboard s leaderboard sales managers can gain more insights into how users are

personalization efforts by looking at the percent of personalized emails sent out of the total number of emails analyzed by regie ai select the name of any regie ai user on the leaderboard list to dig deeper into their chrome extension activity personalization metrics and monitor if they are following the recommended best practices for personalization toward the bottom of an individual s personalization activity page you will find the email breakdown section this shows managers exactly which emails are meeting the established personalization guidelines which emails didn t meet the guidelines and exactly how if you see green check in the personalized column this means the email sent met the standards for personalization more than 10 of the email s content is different from other emails analyzed and sent by the user there has also been a personalized opener and or email body detected a red x in the personalized column lets you know that the email has not met the standards of personalization this tells us that after analysis there are other emails that are extremely similar to the email that was sent there has also been no personalized opener nor personalized email body detected how to track email similarities and differences 1 select the black envelope under the actions column next to the email you want to inspect this opens the email preview as shown below which provides details to the email s content a badge of personalized or not personalized and opportunity to see all similar emails 2 select the show similar emails button in the upper right which provides

        "in general if your primary focus is sales and you have a lower volume of prospects you need to email sequences are a better email automation option however if you are doing marketing emails ex nurture drip campaigns or high volume outreach workflows are likely going to be a better option for email automation please contact your regie csm if you need help deciding on the best strategy for your particular goals key strategic differences between workflows sequences threading reply options what is threading threading means that emails in your campaign will continue on the same thread of email conversation after the first email your subsequent emails will reply to the original email and use the same subject line with a re before it the advantage is that your prospect will have more context all the content you have been sending them in one place workflows not available workflows are comprised of individual marketing email templates and cannot be threaded so when you are crafting these email campaigns make sure that each email can stand on it s own since your recipient will get each email individually sequences available with a caveat sequences can have threading but it is an all or nothing decision in your sequence settings you have to determine if all emails in the sequence will be threaded or none of the emails this can be a disadvantage if you want to test out more than one subject line or start a new thread after your 3rd email note some regie customers that want to use threading for part of their email campaign will create 2 separate sequences with a task to move the prospect to the 2nd sequence after they have finished the first batch of emails ex for the regie multi touch campaign create 1 sequences for emails 1 3 and a 2nd sequence for email 4 reintroduction and emails 5 7 automation limitations workflows are usually comprised of automated emails and there are no limits to the number of emails you add to a workflow sequences have a maximum of 5 automated emails per sequence but you could have additional manual emails tasks and call tasks integration with regie ai hubspot workflows can integrate with regie ai after you export your regie

sales emails from an individual limits on emails and sequences sequences have a daily send limit which will depend on your subscription type the sequences send limit is based on the number of sequences email sends on a given day not the number of new enrollments the limit includes all emails sent immediately when a contact is newly enrolled in a sequence and any scheduled sends from previous enrollments for example if your sequences daily send limit is 500 and you already have 450 emails scheduled to send on a given day you can only schedule an additional 50 sequences email sends that day hubspot will notify you if you try to start a sequence with emails to send on a day when the limit has been reached there is a daily send limit on one to one emails sent from a connected
